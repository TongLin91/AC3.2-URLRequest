   CustomStringConvertible requires a single variable to be defined: description
   
   - Why even conform to CustomStringConvertible, when we can just add a "description" variable?
   -> Because objects that conform to the protocol will let print() statements automatically know
   what should be printed by passing the object in as a sole parameter or in a string interpolation
   
   ---------------------
   example w/o protocol:
   
   let post = PlaceholderPost(userID: 1, id: 1, title: "Title", body: "Body")
   print(post) // prints PlaceholderPost(userId: 1, id: 1, title: "Title", body: "Body")
   
   ---------------------
   example w/ protocol:
   
   let post = PlaceholderPost(userID: 1, id: 1, title: "Title", body: "Body")
   print(post) // prints "TITLE: Title by USER: 1"
   
   ---------------------
   example w/o protocol, but using a variable named 'description':
   
   let post = PlaceholderPost(userID: 1, id: 1, title: "Title", body: "Body")
   print(post) // prints PlaceholderPost(userId: 1, id: 1, title: "Title", body: "Body")
   print(post.description) // prints "TITLE: Title by USER: 1"
   
   - Advanced Note: There are important implications behind the scenes with how Swift handles dynamic dispatch in print(), but that's not entirely relevant or important to know right now. Dynamic dispatch is an abstract concept, and I don't necessarily recommend spending the time to research it at this moment.

 Why do we need this needsIndefiniteExecution propery set to true?
 
 Well, a playground executes its code, line by line, until it reaches the end of the file. At that point, execution terminates and starts over automatically (if you have auto-run enabled. otherwise, execution just ends).
 
 Why does this matter?
 
 Execution for a playground ends the moment the last line is encountered and run. Any asynchronous tasks that are launched, but don't complete in the time Swift needs to run all of the lines of code, the playground will terminate early. So our asynchronous network call gets cancelled long before it finishes.
 By saying that a playground needs indefinite execution time, it signals that the playground needs to keep running code after the last line is reached. In that way, we ensure that an async network call has enough time to be completed
